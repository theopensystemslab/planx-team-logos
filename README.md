# planx-team-logos

Currently used by planx-new for cookie-less images e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theopensystemslab/planx-team-logos/main/lambeth.svg

Considered using https://raw.githack.com/ but it adds a cloudflare cookie so left it with this simple solution for now.

They might get moved to the /public dir of planx or stored on S3 although as they'll be editable by individual teams perhaps its better to keep them separate from the code to begin with.
